To customize this code, download a fresh copy of Tom Mcfarlin's plugin boilerplate from [His Repository @Github](https://github.com/tommcfarlin/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate) and unzip it somewhere in your server. Then set that folder's path as `$root` in line #5. And make sure that you give that folder write permission.

That's mainly it. Everything else will be taken care by this code generator.
